## Introduction

thirdweb engine is a backend server that provides a HTTP interface to interact with any smart contract on any evm chain. Engine handles creating and managing backend wallets, enabling high throughput with automatic nonce and gas management.

The high level functionality of thirdweb engine:

<!-- Source: https://whimsical.com/engine-architecture-2G6rXEvUM2HFmVwKxPWyzS -->
<img src="./docs/images/overview.png" alt="Overview" width="820">

- Create & transact with **backend wallets** (Local, AWS KMS, Google KMS, etc.)
- High reliability transaction execution with **wallet nonce management**, **automatic transaction retrying** and **gas management**
- Deploy and interact with [erc-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart wallets, handle session keys & sending user operations
- Deploy published smart contracts (any EVM chain)
- Read, write and interact with smart contracts (any evm chain)
- Run in your own cloud or use the thirdweb managed service
- Fine-grained user access controls & wallet based client-side authentication [Coming Soon]
- Gasless relayer, bundler, and paymaster for gasless transactions [Coming Soon]

This project is in `alpha` - if you're looking for specific features & or want to give feedback, reach out to us!

## Requirements

1. Docker
2. Postgres DB

## Getting started

### Setup environment variables

Set these environment variables to get started.

| Variable Name             | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` | Create an API KEY on thirdweb Dashboard and copy the SecretKey.                                                  |
| `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` | Postgres connection string, format: postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]    |
| `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS`    | The initial admin wallet address that can connect to this engine instance from the thirdweb dashboard for setup. |

### Run the server

Run the server using Docker with the following command.

```
docker run \
    -e THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY="<your-api-secret-key>" \
    -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="<your-connection-url>" \
    -e ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS="<your-admin-wallet-address>" \
    -p 3005:3005 \
    thirdweb/engine:latest
```

### Using the server

- Every request to the server requires an authentication token for admin actions use the thirdweb SecretKey. Use the `Authorization` Header to set the value shown below:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <thirdweb SecretKey>`
- Every write request to the server also requires the `x-backend-wallet-address` header to specify which admin wallet to send a transaction with. Use the following format to set this header:

  - `x-backend-wallet-address: 0x3ecdbf3b911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373`
